                        My first portfolio entry is a collection of static web-pages designed to display information of a tourist 
                        attraction in the South-East. It is built solely using HTML & CSS & also utilises Bootstrap for it's layout & 
                        styling. Finally it encorporates the Hover.css library in order to add a level of animation to the buttons & 
                        increase the overall user experience.

                        <b>Responsive design -</b> The site was designed using a mobile first approach. Both the navbar & informational/functional divs expand on larger screens to utilise the full screen of the user & display information more concisely with a greater proportion of elements being displayed above the fold.

                        <b>Border timeline -</b> A border timeline has been included & is visible on larger screen sizes on the Places Of Interest page to visually demonstrate to the user that the locations being described are in the order that they will be experienced by the user in real life should they be travelling one direction.

                        <b>Contact -</b> when fully connected this allows the user to contact the administrator for more information. 
                        This will help the administrator to review & determine if additional information/features are to be included 
                        in future.

                        <b>Gallery -</b> In future I would like to implement a gallery section where users could upload images which the site 
                        administrator could then "pin" to the top of the page.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Facilities Page -</b> In future a features page could be implemented to provide additional information. To date this 
                        information is not available. The features page was included in the original wireframes however all the 
                        information is not available as of yet (toilets, parking, child/elderly/disable friendly, & water stations) so 
                        this is currently omitted.

                        <b>Email.js -</b> prior to launch the contact section will need to be wired up.  To achieve this I plan to use the

                        To demonstrate my use of JavaScript logic I developed an in browser version of the 1980s game Simon.  The game
                        takes place on one webpage & jQuery is used to select elements & update the HTML with new score & roll values.  
                        Additionally this project makes use of the latest HTML capabilities with the use of the HTML5 audio tag which
                        is used to improve user experience by adding sound to button clicks.
                        <br>
                        This project also makes use of the Jasmine testing library to ensure high quality code.

                        <b>New Game button -</b> The New Game button allows users to reset the current score html element & reset the two score 
                        arrays (computer & player). It then allows the user to run the computerGo function which starts the game by 
                        pushing a random value (between 1-4) to the newly clearer computerScore array. This also results in a flash of 
                        the appropriately coloured button by adding & removing a class which alters the background colour of the button.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Difficulty drop down button -</b> The difficulty drop down button allows the user to alter the speed at which 
                        the computer iterates through each value in it's score array (the interation is carried out in the computerGo 
                        function). The difficulty can be updated mid-game & even mid-iteration as the difficulty value is pulled during 
                        each iteration of the loop in computerGo.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Simon buttons -</b> The four coloured buttons (Simon buttons) allow the user to interact with the computer. 
                        When clicked; 1- A flash is added & removed by adding a css class to the selected button which changes it's 
                        background colour. The class is then removed after a delay using a setTimeout. 2- The button's value (unique to 
                        each button) is pushed to the player's score array (playerScore). 3- The buttons value is compared to the 
                        corresponding value in the computer's score array (computerScore). If not the gameOver function is run & the 
                        user can no longer interact with the Simon buttons (as gameOver disables the buttons). 4- The current score 
                        element's html is updated to reflect the number of buttons pressed. 5- If the current score is greater than 
                        the current score the high score element's html is updated. 6- If the player has pressed the same number of 
                        buttons as the computer (ie the length of their arrays are equal) computerGo is run which will render the Simon 
                        buttons temporarily unusable for the user (as computerGo disables the buttons).

                        <b>Hint Button -</b> One potential feature which I may impliment at a later date is the use of a hint button. 
                        This would be implimented by; 1- Defining a hint variable with a numeric value. This would be the number of 
                        hints available which I would suggest to be 3. 2- Creation of a html button which, when clicked runs a hint 
                        function (hint()). 3- The hint function would use the currentGo variable and apply it to the computerScore 
                        array (computerScore[currentGo]). This would be used to return the value of the button which the player has 
                        to press next. This returned value would be passed through a number of if/if else statements & a flash returned
                        based on the value returned (as occurs in the computerGo function). The value in the hint variable (step 1) 
                        would then be decreased by one to lower the number of remaining hints available. In summary the hint button 
                        would allow the user to see which button they have to press next.

                        project I built a recipe database application which allows users to sign in, create/delete entries in the back end,
                        add/remove bookmaked recipes, & also search recipes by author name or ingredient.
                        Communication with the back end was achieved through the use of the PyMongo library.

                        <b>Recipe Page - </b>The My Recipes page (which can be accessed from the button in the nav of the same name or by 
                        clicking the application logo in the center of the nav) utilises the jinja templating language to loop through & 
                        render each recipe written by the user. It does so by passing in all recipes as an argument when rendering the 
                        url & then, through use of a jinja if statement rendering only those recipes who's author matches that of the 
                        username entered at the start of the session.  The page then uses the same method to render all recipes which 
                        the user has bookmarker by checking if the bookmarkers field contains the substring matching the username.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Browse Functionality -</b> The Browse functionality can be accessed via the Browse tab. It displays a number 
                        of carousels consisting of thumbnail images & recipe names. Upon click the individual recipe is rendered on a 
                        separate tab. The purpose of this section is to allow the user to browse many recipes visually & by category in
                        order to quickly process & narrow many recipes (as opposed to a list detailing all recipes or recipes details). 
                        At the top of the Browse page is the promoted carousel which is to be utilised by the application administrator 
                        as outlined above in the UX section.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Upload Recipe Functionality -</b> As this application is to be comprised primarily of user generated content
                        it was imperative that the user be given the ability to upload their own recipes. To achieve this a form has 
                        been created on the Upload Recipe page. The form was designed to incorporate not only textboxes but also 
                        checkboxes & a slider to give some variety to the user. The author name field is populated automatically.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Search Functionality -</b> The search feature allows the user to search based on a number of parameters 
                        (recipe name, ingredients, & author). This feature will become more relevant with a greater number of user 
                        generated content. The functionality was designed to be as minimalistic as possible.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Bookmark add/remove buttons -</b> The add/remove bookmark feature was implemented to give users the ability 
                        to save recipes which have been generated by other users.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Delete buttons -</b> The delete feature allows users to delete recipes they themselves authored.

                        <br>
                        <b>Additional search capabilities -</b> In future I would like to impliment the ability to search by additional 
                        parameters such as difficulty & category. I would also like to include the ability to search by multiple 
                        criteria & a search function on the My Recipes page to allow the user to search through their own recipes 
                        (bookmarked & authored). Additionally I would like to remove the case sensitivity of the search by manipulating 
                        the search input.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Update authored recipes -</b> I would like to grant the user the ability to update their own authored recipes.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Photo upload -</b> I would like to give the user the ability to upload a photo file locally as opposed to a 
                        photo-url.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>User feedback -</b> I would like to impliment either a comment section or ratings system to allow other users
                        to provide feedback on recipes. Once this is implemented I would then include it as a search parameter.

                        <b>Additional technologies</b> - Bootswatch/Bootstrap, Materialize, jQuery, Django, Jinja2, Postgres, 
                        Stripe, S3/IAM (AWS Buckets) <br><br>
                        
                        Django is a more heavy-duty Python framework that comes with a lot of capabilities under the hood.  Using Django
                        I built a newspaper application which rendeds different data depending on whether or not the user is signed-in
                        & whether or not the signed-in user is an author.  I also utilised the built in Django admin panel to manage 
                        users & permissions & also delete articles hosted with the back-end.
                        <br>
                        Stripe is also incorporated into this application to allow users to donate to the Newspaper.
                        <br>
                        The back-end of this application is built using Postgres (a resource which can be added to Heroku where this app
                        is deployed). The app uses a relational database type (the comment section references it's secondary key against 
                        the articles primary key). Hosting of static files is achieved using S3/IAM (AWS Buckets).
                        <br>
                        Finally automated testing of this application was carried out using Djangos built in TestCase suite.

                        <br>
                        <b>Registration & Authentication -</b> The application makes use of Djangos build in authentication functionality. As 
                        can be seen within the Navbar upon entering the site the options to register of log-in are provided. Users are 
                        also prompted to sign in should they wish to comment or donate. Authentication is used to determine what is 
                        rendered within the HTML & therefore is used to established what the user can interact with.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Django Groups -</b> As previously mentioned this application makes use of Djangos group functionality. A group has 
                        been created from within the admin panel named 'journalists'. Registered users are then added to this group 
                        should the administrator wish them to have the capability to upload articles to be view by other visitors/users 
                        or the site. Rendering the 'write' option is controlled from within the URL views where it is determined if the 
                        user is a member of the 'journalists' group. Should this be the case a variable is passed into the rendering 
                        dictionary with a value or true. Should this not be the case this variable is set to false. Jinja then rendered 
                        based on this Boolean value.
                        <br> To avoid a user breaking the site by entering the appropriate URL that allows journalists to write & upload 
                        an article while not being included in that group the view redirects unless the user is in said group. This can 
                        be seen at line 71 of articles/views.py & is tested for in the articles/test_views.py file (second test).
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Stripe/Payment Functionality -</b> This application makes use of the Stripe API in order to process electronic 
                        payments. These payments (in the form of donations) are to be used by the administrator to generate revenue. 
                        The Stripe API connected via the stripe.js file which can be seen from within the static/js folder. The inputs 
                        passed to Stripe for processing are established using Djangos forms & models (of which some values are obtained 
                        by passing these forms into the donate.html page) & passed from within the donate/views.py file.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Search Functionality -</b> The application implements search capabilities. This is done from with the search app 
                        which is then imported into the main project (newspaper). Search input is referenced against headlines, tags 
                        (which are metadata invisible to readers), & author names. Searches do not have to be an exact match.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Article Views -</b> There are two main views available to the user (excluding the journalists) - the all-articles 
                        page & the full-article page. By default the landing page which a user will come across will be index.html which
                        will render all articles present in the database. These are filtered in descending order to allow the most
                        recent articles to be displayed first. The second view is that which displays fullarticle.html. This view takes
                        the primary key as an argument in order to render the selected article. This primary key is also passed into the
                        comments database to return those comments which apply to that particular article. As previously mentioned it is
                        also possible within the view to submit a comment should the user be logged in.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Journalist Profile/Dashboard -</b> This application provides journalists with a My Profile tab. From this webpage
                        the journalists are provided with a simple metrics dashboard which is comprised of six metrics - the number of
                        articles that they have written, the number of views on these articles, & the number of comments on these
                        articles. These three metrics are then provided for the past week to give the journalists a more recent focus
                        on their performance.
                        <br>Within this section it is also possible for journalists to update their articles. This was done to allow 
                        journalists to upload breaking stories while allowing them the flexibility of updating these as more information 
                        is to hand. It also allows them to correct any errors without having to reupload the article. Finally it is also
                        the vision of the app that journalists will be able to perform a/b testing on their articles (adding different
                        hashtag or keywords into headings) to increase their clickrate & interactivity. A decision was made however to
                        not allow journalists to remove articles as it is believed that this control should ultimately remain with the
                        administrator.

                        <br>
                        <b>Pagination -</b> As the site grows & additional articles are uploaded it would not be practical to display all entries on the home page or on the search results page should the search return many results. As a result I would implement pagination using Bootstrap while keeping in line with the Bootswatch 'Lux' theme.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Top articles or custom sort -</b> At present articles are displayed based on their published date. As the database grows I believe it would be beneficial to add functionality to allow users to view articles based on different metrics such as 'most-commented' or 'most-viewed' articles of the past day or week.
                        
                        <b>Sub navbar for categories -</b> Currently the application offers search functionality however no categories are present. It would be beneficial to include another navbar below the current navbar which returns articles related to varying topics (Tech, Science, Sport, Weather, Europe, Asia, etc). This could be achieved through targetting the tags journalists currently attached to their articles. Alternatively a categories checkbox input could be included on the 'Write' page.

                <!-- Features -->
                <div *ngSwitchCase="'Features'" [@enterTrigger]="'fade'">

                        <b>Animations -</b> This application makes use of Angulars animation modules & defines a number of reusable animations
                        which can be found throughout the app.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Routing -</b> This app uses Angulars routing modules to render separate components.  This allows the user to create & 
                        destroy data as it needs to as opposed to downloading & storing the entire application code at one time.  This increases
                        page load speed & user experience.

                <!-- Future Implimentation -->
                <div *ngSwitchCase="'Future Implimentation'" [@enterTrigger]="'fade'">
                    <div>
                        <br>
                        <b>Email.js -</b>  At present my email address is display in the contact section.  I hope to create an input field
                        & submit data using the email.js library which will allow users to send emails directly from this app to my email
                        address.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>Additional animations -</b> currently a slide-in animation is applied when some new components are created.  
                        I hope to create a corresponding slide out animation which will slide the old component off screen before 
                        deletion.  In order to achieve this I believe I will have to add a listener to the app-router that will 
                        trigger the animation before the new route is applied.
